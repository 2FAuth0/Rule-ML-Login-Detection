# Biometric Login Detection System
## Layered Detection of Suspicious Logins Using Keystroke Dynamics Rules, Machine Learning


This project evaluates a layered detection system for identifying suspicious login behavior using both rule-based logic and supervised machine learning (ML). The goal is to compare detection performance across rule-only, ML-only, and combined (hybrid) models.

## Deliverables
- Reproducible notebook (or Colab link)
- Evaluation metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1, confusion matrix
- Final report and short demo video
